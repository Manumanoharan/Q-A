1. What is Semantic tag?
   ~The semantic element is that it clearly communicated its meaning to both the developer and the browser.
   ~These elements clearly define its content.
(e.g)
   -<article>
   -<aside>
   -<details>
   -<figcaption>
   -<figure>
   -<footer>
   -<header>
   -<main>
   -<mark>
   -<nav>
   -<section>
   -<summary>
   -<time>

2.Position concept in css?
     ~The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document(top,,right,bottom,left). 
     ~The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
     
     ~There are five different position values:
     -static
     -relative
     -fixed
     -absolute
     -sticky

3.Display inline and inline block?
   -Inline block
       ~Its occupied with full width
       ~They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins. 
       ~It does not contain any other elements next to it
      Examples:
          -<h1>-<h6>
          -<div>
          -<table>
          -<li>
          -<ul>
          -<ol>

     -Inline elements
        ~ Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline.
        ~ Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.
      Examples:
         -<a>
         -<br>
         -<script>
         -<input>
         -<span>
         -<img>

4.What is the use of doctype HTML?
     ~Doctype HTML is a declaration that tells the browser what version of HTML the document is written in.

 5. Purpose of meta tag?
     ~The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document.
     ~<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords
     , author of the document, and viewport settings.
     ~Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
     ~Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
